Data cleaning is identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in datasets to ensure data quality. It involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting faulty entries, and standardizing formats. 


Data Cleaning and Visualization using Python and Power BI

I performed data cleaning and visualization in this project to derive meaningful insights. Using Python, I handled the data preprocessing tasks, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and standardizing formats. Libraries like Pandas and NumPy were utilized for efficient data manipulation, while Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for initial visualizations and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Once the data was clean, I transferred it to Power BI for advanced visualizations and dashboard creation. Power BI allowed me to create interactive reports, providing key stakeholders with insights through charts, graphs, and KPIs. This combination of Python for cleaning and Power BI for visualization ensured data accuracy and effective communication of insights for data-driven decision-making.!![visual](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94f0368e-5128-46eb-87b0-fbc953b9fcef)
